        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">My History</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> I first joined roblox on the 17th march 2020 during the covid pandamic. I was bored and was looking for something to do with my IRL friends. I played for months nonstop and discovered the wonders of roblox and all the communities around it. The first time I was presented to an actual community was when i played Cabin Crew Simulator. At that time I had no discord account, so I created one and joined the Cruising Studios Discord Server. Later I also discovered Emergency Response: Liberty County and joined the Police Roleplay Community Discord Server.<br>
          <br>From a ER:LC Private Server Discord I met someone who would forever change my life. This was Seargent AJ. Our story is long but I'll try and put it all in one phrase: Me meet him, me and him become friends, me sneek into his new server develpoment team, me become COO, me and him grow server, me become CEO, me get big bobux, him leave me server, me too busy to take care of server so me sell server. Me and him never talked again lol.<br>
          <br>My first contact with Ro-Aviation was from a LA Airways flight, whom game I was recomended because of me playing Cabin Crew Sim. After that I was
introduced to many actual non p2w airlines. The one I enjoyed more was Kanda Airways. I really had a lot of fun working for them, their flights were some times full and sometimes empty, but just getting to play with all the tech was fun, and I didn't mind the flight fullness at all, I would just do my job. Month after me joining Kanda, the server started dieing. I wasn't really able to dedicate a lot of time to it anymore since I was too busy with school. The
owner (Kronzicle) fell out with the CEO and holder (BearBoi). This fight resulted on Kronz leaving Kanda for good and the airline loosing all its funding Many attempts of reviving it were dong but no luck. So, unfortunatly, the airline shutdown for good. Right now, the Ex-CEO (BearBoi) has gotten a new
job at Finnair Roblox as President and Kronz has not been seen after.<br>
          <br>With working at Kanda. I really wanted to start my own airline. I bought the Polaris A320 and the PROP airstairs and gained an airport from Finotech
where I started operating. Later, as my budget went up, I was able to update to more and better posessions.<br>
          <br>Around about the time that Kanda started dieing. I joined the Cruising Studios staff team as a trial moderator. I was promoted to Junior Moderator 2 weeks after, as I finished my trial perioud. One month later, I was promoted to senior and a few months later I passed my Administrator Application, a
role which I still have up to date.<br>
          <br>Fastforwarding to more recent times. I met a good friend, FYX, who I talk with every day. I closed my original airline and created a new one. I became a trial project manager for a very important company in roblox, PodTech Roblox. I also learned LUA scripting, UI designing and scripting and CSG modeling and all this skills were put into the creation of Kiosko. We have high ambitions for the release of our first products and are focused on developing high
quality products for the community to enjoy at affordable prices.<br>
          <br>This is my story. I started from barelly no experience and no money to being an influencial role-model (don't ask me who told me I was their role model LOL). If there is a lesson to take from this is that if I was able to do it, you are too. Nowadays you can find many free tools to help you start your business and start producing. The trick is to start and presist. Don't take success forgranted, it's something that will take a while to obtain. Just keep working hard
to being better than you were yesterday everyday and you'll get somewhere!<br>
